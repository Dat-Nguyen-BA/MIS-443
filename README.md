# Business Data Management - MIS-443
## 8-Week SQL Challenges - [Case Study 4 - Data Bank](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-4/)

## Project Overview
### Background
The financial industry is experiencing a major shift with the rise of Neo-Banks, which are fully digital banks without physical branches. Building on this trend, Danny has conceptualized Data Bank, a digital bank that combines traditional banking services with secure distributed data storage.

Unlike standard banks, Data Bank links customersâ€™ cloud storage allocation directly to the amount of money in their accounts. The more funds a customer holds, the more storage they are entitled to.

### Key Innovation
- Banking + Cryptocurrency + Data Storage integration.
- Distributed storage platform for maximum security.
- Dynamic allocation model: storage capacity tied to account balance.

### Business Goals
- Increase total customer base through innovative services.
- Accurately forecast storage needs to ensure seamless scaling.
- Use data-driven metrics to analyze growth trends and optimize planning.

### Challenges
- Predicting future storage demand based on account growth and balance changes.
- Tracking customer growth and storage usage patterns over time.
- Ensuring scalability of infrastructure to match financial and data service expansion.

### Project Objectives
- Calculate key metrics (customer growth, storage demand, usage trends).
- Create forecasting models for future infrastructure requirements.
- Provide data analysis to support marketing, operations, and product strategies.

### Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive growth and storage requirement report.
- Visualized data trends and forecasts for decision-making.
- Strategic recommendations to align customer acquisition goals with technical capacity planning.
